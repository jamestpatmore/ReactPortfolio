## Description 
This is my awesome portfolio :rice_scene: I was very ecstatic to make this project as I feel like my portfolio needed a revamp  :sparkler: There are a lot of attractive features for this application (which i will go over shortly) :arrow_double_down:


Here is a screenshot of the app! :camera::camera::camera:
![homepage screenshot](../../Downloads/reactportss.png)

What makes this portfolio so user friendly is the smooth mobile responsive nature to it as well as the one page structure, while also having an elemental change throughout the experience. 


You can view the app with its deployment link [here](https://jamestpatmore.github.io/react-portfolio/)

## User Story

```md
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
``` 

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
WHEN I load the portfolio
THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
WHEN I view the header
THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
WHEN I view the navigation titles
THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
WHEN I click on a navigation title
THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted
WHEN I load the portfolio the first time
THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default
WHEN I am presented with the About Me section
THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them
WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section
THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories
WHEN I am presented with the Contact section
THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message
WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text
THEN I receive a notification that this field is required
WHEN I enter text into the email address field
THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address
WHEN I am presented with the Resume section
THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies
WHEN I view the footer
THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)
```

## Usage 

What makes this portfolio is awesome is the fact that the recruiters or anyone really can subscribe to my newsletter and i can send them updates on my carrer and different applications I make or am in the process of making. Which then creates a following which is vital for any creator. :telescope:

Secondly, the contact form section is fully functional and will give me the details of all their information, including a message statement straight to my email!!  :e-mail:

This is all powered by Mailchimp  :postbox: :postbox: :postbox:

Also there are icons on the NavBar which will lead the user straight to either my Github/LinkedIn/or my Instagram account (currently working on my Developer Instagram).  :chart_with_upwards_trend:

Lastly, I do have some clones that I am working on for the sake of privacy I will not share that code with the public, and they are a work in progress. But, I do have my 6 projects on there and the Github will show all of my public repositories. :trident:
